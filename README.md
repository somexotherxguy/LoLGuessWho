# LoLGuessWho ([Live Site](http://somexotherxguy.github.io/))
Submission for the 2016 Riot API Challange.

A game where the user tries to guess a summoner's top 3 mastery champions. It can be a game to play amongst friends or even to see how well you know your favorite pro-player/streamer.

The website has a very striaght-forward design in which the user uses the search bar at the bottom of the page to make champion guesses. Number of guesses and total time taken are acting as a sort of grade for how well the user did. The lower the time and guesses the better the user performed. Also this allows people to determine a winner out of a group of friends, and show off how well they know the searched summoner.
