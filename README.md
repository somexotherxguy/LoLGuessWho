# LoLGuessWho
Submission for the 2016 Riot API Challange.

A game to where the user tries to guess a summoner's top 3 mastery champions. It can be a game to play amongst friends or even try to guess for your favorite pro-player/streamer.

The website has a very striaght-forward design in which the user uses the search bar at the bottom of the page to make champion guesses. Number of guesses and total time taken are acting as a sort of grade for how well the user did. The lower the time and guess the better the user performed. Also this allows people to determine a winner out of a group of friends, and show off how well they know the searched summoner.

# How to Set Up the Website
The website is made using the ever-so-normal HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a node.js server running on amazon web services. This means there is almost no setup required besides cloning the files with "git clone" and then opening the home.html in your preferred browser (however chrome had the most testing done with it so I would suggest using it).
